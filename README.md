# (Party) Game of the Week

Have you ever had a game that all your friends were playing for a week, but then never heard of it again? Many people have names for these kinds of games, such as "Game of the Week", and go through many such games.

## What is a "Game of the Week"?

I consider a game to meet the criteria for a game of the week if it meets the following:
- Cheap or free
- Easy to jump into and out of
- Not permanent progression-based
- Shorter game loop

_Most importantly:_
- **You play it with your friends**

### Examples:
- PEAK
- Lethal Company
- R.E.P.O
- Phasmophobia

When I think of a game of the week, those are the kinds of games that come to mind. You have a relatively short gameplay loop (typically < 1 hour to several hours) without any permanent progression, and can start a new run at any time without any strings attached.

## What is this site?
This site hopes to make finding such games easier, so you can spend more time keeping up with fun games with your friends and less time trying to figure out what to play.

The site pulls new games from steam that meet the general criteria, and presents them newest to oldest.
